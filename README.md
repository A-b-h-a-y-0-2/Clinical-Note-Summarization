# Clinical-Note-Summarization
This project aims to build a Clinical Note Summarizer using machine learning models to extract and summarize clinical information from electronic health records (EHRs) stored in XML format. The project involves data processing, feature extraction, model training, and deployment to summarize clinical notes for easier analysis and better insights.


## Dataset used:
  Data used for the following project is PubMed Central (PMC) Open Access Subset.
  
## Remaining Tasks

### Data Preprocessing Enhancements
- [ ] Improve data cleaning and feature extraction.
- [ ] Handle missing or incomplete data points.

### Model Improvements
- [ ] Perform hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, etc.).
- [ ] Investigate and implement advanced summarization models like BART or T5.

### Evaluation and Validation
- [ ] Perform cross-validation on the model.
- [ ] Conduct human evaluation for the quality of summaries.

### Deployment
- [ ] Integrate the model into a Flask-based API.
- [ ] Optimize the model for faster inference time and lower memory usage.

### Documentation and Final Report
- [ ] Finalize project documentation (README, installation instructions, usage).
- [ ] Prepare the final project report summarizing the challenges and solutions.
